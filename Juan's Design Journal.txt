Game-A-Week 2:
Topic: Berlin:

06.10.20
- After receiving the topic I tried thinking on a variety of games, but either couldn't flesh out the idea or it felt too complex to develope in just a week.
- Some of said ideas included climbing the Fernsehtrum... just because; wondering around the Berlin U-Bahn system; and digging game creating a tunnel under the Berlin wall.
- I figured out that to develope a game in just a week I should think in just one mechanic and really focus on it.
- Time to sleep came and I still didn't have an idea, I couldn't sleep because in the back of my mind I was still thinking on ideas... until an idea that really convinced me hit.
- The idea has this background: In the era of the wall of Berlin tunnels were dug to escape from the east to the west, but they were held very secretive so the GDR authorities wouldn't catch them.
- Generally information was given within circles of close friends and family and often wouldn't be direct and complete but was rather released in pieces. This is because many people could inform the authorities and the plan would be ruined, as well as the risk of stumbuling upon th Stasi (the GDR's secret police).
- The game would then be a person in their home planning an escape; people would come to their door and be asked a question, if they deliver with the right answer within a code the player would have to give them a note with the right date, time and place; if they answer wrong they should give a decoy.
- Also agents from the Stasi could come, instead of a decoy they should be given stasi propaganda.
- I would like to make illustrations for the game, especially creating different endings depending on the amount of mistakes made (or rather just decissions taken).
- Now is time to sleep.

07.10.20
- I was worried that I wouldn't be able to deliever with the art department if I would also had to deal with the code for the mechanics.
- I shared ideas with friends to see what we all had. After this Gus and Lenny asked if I wanted to team up. I accepted their offer since they could take care of the game's code while I could for the first time in a project focus on the art.
- Researched about the Tunnel 57, most successfull tunnel of the wall, and around which I wanted to make the plot
- Did a flow diagram to explain the game to my teammates.

08.10.20
- We met to get a clearer explanation of the game's idea and to brainstorm over it.
- Delivered the main game idea and loops.
- We divided roles and created a to-do lists (I got in charge of the art, mainly the ending screens' illustrations, while Lenny made the other assets, at least until I could work on them).
- We also made our repo and made a spreadsheet to put dialogs and story elements.
- Thought about the different endings and wrote them down in the spreadsheet, organizing them in priority order codingwise.
- I started drawing sketches for the illustrations.

09.10.20
- We met to track progress.
- I mainly worked on finishing the sketches for the endscreen illustrations.

10.10.20
- Put the sketches into the project so they could work with them into incorporating the endingscreens in the game while the final illustrations were ready.
- Mainly worked on shading the endscreen illustrations, focusing on characters to be noticeable.

11.10.20
- Finished flat shading of the illustrations and started working on blending it.

12.10.20
- Finished the endscreen illustrations, at this point my teammates had the code and mechanics of the game pretty much done.
- Changed the sketches for the now finished illustrations.
- Lenny had done all of the other art assests, so I just went over them, reworking most of them and overall just making the visuals more polished and the art more consistent.
- I basically changed the typography and redrew the main gameplay scene and menu elements over Lenny's interations.
- Tried the game one last to find out that the game pretty much breaks the second time you play it. However, it was to late to notify Gus, who was responsible for most of the code related to this, since he had already called it a day and went to sleep (this was already late at night).
- Had to accept that the bugs were going to stay there and proceeded to make the final build of the game to upload it to itch.io.
- I also made a quick logo for the app launcher and the itch banner.
